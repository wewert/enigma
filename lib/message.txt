I don't know if this will work but I'm going to work as hard as I can to
understand every step that I take to learn Ruby. I am very stressed at my
current progress based on the requirements to move up. I would like to have more
hands on small parts to work on that will help me with concepts. The projects
seem to be more of a stressor then a teaching method. I hope there is some kind
of help before it's too late. I don't know what is the normal feeling I'm
supposed to have while here. How do you know if you are doing well? Is it all
the markers they've laid out. If so, I was done by my first project evaluation.
All I want to do is learn and do this.
